    Filters an EEG signal using a Butterworth filter.

    Parameters:
    - signal (array-like): The EEG signal to be filtered. This should be a one-dimensional array of values.
    - fc (float): The cutoff frequency for the filter in Hz. Must be less than half the sampling rate (fs/2).
    - filttype (str): The type of the filter. Acceptable values are 'low', 'high', 'bandpass', and 'bandstop'.
    - fs (float): The sampling rate of the EEG signal in Hz.

    Returns:
    - array-like: The filtered EEG signal.

    Raises:
    - AssertionError: If the cutoff frequency is greater than or equal to half the sampling rate.

    - This function uses the Butterworth filter from the `scipy.signal` module.

    Finds the peaks and troughs in a given signal.

    This function identifies the peaks and troughs of a signal by computing its first derivative

    Parameters:
    - signal (array-like): A one-dimensional array of numeric values representing the signal.

    Returns:
    - tuple: A tuple containing two arrays:
        1. An array of indices indicating the locations of the troughs.
        2. An array of indices indicating the locations of the peaks.

    Notes:
    - Peaks are regions where the signal increases and then decreases, while troughs are regions where the signal decreases and then increases.
    - This function may not capture all peaks or troughs if the signal has very small fluctuations or noise.
